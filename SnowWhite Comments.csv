"Snow Latina doesn’t eat a poison apple, instead she drinks tequila (jk)"
if the ending involves this variation of snow white eating the poison apple and the prince running away and not saving her I&#39;ll go see it.
Nope🥱
Just 1 more day until we get to see the box office numbers not roll in! Yay!
Get woke go broke
I hope her carrier ends with this movie
Why People hate this movie? Why? Give some explanation please
I&#39;ve seen interviews where she talks like an A-lister despite being a nobody 😂 Is this her? Yikes!
"I thought it was Snow White ,not snow Latina"
Disney fukt up snow white
"A movie about beauty in both ways. Disney taught me true beauty lies within. Rachel IS a beautiful woman, yes, but the only reason she doesn&#39;t look it in this movie is because her personality is not beautiful. Disservice to Snow White, the fairest of them all."
Pretty expensive for a movie about a woman living together with 7 single men.
I hope the &quot;evil&quot; queen marries the prince at the end.
WHY mess up a<br>beloved classic ?<br>🙁👎🏽
"i&#39;d reshoot everything, with an appropriate cast. Possibly would be a hit and compensate this insult. Same with little mermaid."
It looks like the movie has more voice actors than actual actors.
Skasowali mój post ok Królewna Śnieżka wygląda jak nie powiem cooo . A królowa jest piękniejsza. O co w tej adaptacji chodzi.  Ten Świat sie kończy.   Disney przewraca się w grobie. Dno dna szambo muł szlaka syf kiła mogiła.
Maybe Disney will finally learn it’s time to stop hiring leftist/democrat cultists and stop pushing their cancerous ideology onto children
Am i the only one disappointed  mainly at &quot;snow whites&quot; voice sges specifically  supposed to have a damsel calm like singing type tone and voice lets not even talk about her hair or cheap lookung dress but what makes snow white snow white ISNT THERE HER VOICE ISNT FEMININE  AND HIGH PITCHED
Searched this trailer up only to dislike it.
"Currently, this video hold 13million views, 58k likes and 1.7million dislikes.<br><br>Looking forward to a box-office bomb news next week. 😂"
"Wow another movie where they use the same title and some of the same characters, but destroy the storyline"
A YouTube video showing animal cruelty would actually get a better ratio. There are unwell people out there liking this video.
Y&#39;all better figure out how to monetize comments or sell bad news or SUMPN this lookin rough y&#39;all
"I paid nothing to watch this trailer, but I already want my money back."
omg. so I heard the trailer was bad... this doesnt in anyway inspire my attendance.. and certainly not my money.
Bella Blancanieves
Why do Disney keep doing this 🥲
If i saw this movie on a plane. I would still walk out.
I&#39;ll give Disney some credit. They are brave enough to leave the comment section open😂
"Solo vine para darle mi pulgar abajo, q porquería"
How am I supposed to seriously believe this version of Snow White(Zegler) is more beautiful than the queen(Gadot)? This feels like miscasting to me.
The greatest fantasy is that Gal Gadot isn&#39;t the fairest woman in this movie...
No need to see Nancy Pelosi&#39;s rough childhood.
"Tomorrow,<br>We shall experience madness, Corruption, Plague and WORST OF ALL:<br><br>DOOM"
I CAME HERE JUST TO DROP A DISLIKE AND LEAVE ASAP
I bet the Queen is the true main character here.
Who is this for?
"Oh they should switch character, The Queen is prettier than Snow White. 😂"
TRASH MOVIE
"Snow Woke.  Disney, stop with the propaganda and make movies people want to see."
Snow White belongs to cartoon film 1937.
Why didnt  they just get little people/person with short stature  actors as dwarves  cos the dwarves hear are so  cartoonish i thought this is a live action.
the CGI….😭
Why can’t she at least do a character voice? No one wants to watch an actor play themselves in a Disney Princess role
I&#39;m so mad 😠🤬😂
"13,344,654 views and only 58 thousand likes? Probably Disney employees."
"What’s up with the creepy CGI dwarves? You can’t tell me “woke” Hollywood couldn’t find 7 little people. <br>Maybe they found some, but they weren’t LGBT enough for Disney😂😂😂😂😂"
Disney really has a way of making the worst adaptations out there. It’s almost like Netflix and Disney are brothers
Return my Disney princesses immediately!
So... What&#39;s all the fuss about looks great to me ❤
"Admit it, you all are here for the comments. As do I."
"Bad, Disney. Bad."
Looking forward to seeing the Daily Wire version.
I think i rather see the one from 1937…
Mirror mirror on my door when did Disney get so poor?
Me: have you ever heard of roasting?<br>Rachel: no<br>Me: well you’re gonna learn in like two seconds
I just hope ppl dont watch this movie
"This movie should come with a disclaimer no dwarves were abused in the making, but your monitor might be"
"Mirror Mirror on the wall, why are the seats empty in the cinema hall?"
saddd my frıend are snow whıte lover buut she cant get what she expect to the snow whıte character are not ın here huhu hope dısney next make ıt same as the orıgınal but you are guys are wnderfull team thankyou for the movıe
Mirror mirror on my door why is Rachel’s acting so poor?
"Nah i would scream too <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV46TJKL8cU&amp;t=82"">1:22</a>"
"Dear Disney, this is a mess…"
Snow not so white
"This movie didn&#39;t hit on theatres, it invaded it"
hope queen win this time
"I’m here for the comments - love them! As for the movie cut the $hit, exit stage left"
Just switch cast 😢😂
I rather sing thick of it from the stage. Then watch this
"Comments here are so supportive, but in other sites, they mocked this masterpiece"
Lord ffarquad has a long lost twin that looks just like him
They really decided to make our childhood romantic story into a Marvel Avengers battle film 😅 <br><br>Disney NEED to go to Dreamwork and have some lessons about HTTYD.
Snow White is gonna be the first movie that no one will ever gonna pirate
Got a quarter way through this trailer and want a refund for my eyes
Ha this will be the lowest rated and revenue yielding movie in the history of Disney. Woke will destroy them. Good riddance!!!
It says a lot when not even the jurno shills like this dumpster fire 😂😂
"Disney, give me the admission fee"
Lmao there are tons of comments with more likes than this video has. 😂😂😂
this movie sucks
"I just saw the movie on a pirate website, I had enough after a few minutes... <br>The movie is horrendous 😂 That snowbrown is awful lol There&#39;s no way i&#39;m paying to watch this in the theaters."
With the film releasing I have to admit I do admire the bravery of Disney leaving the comment section open throughout the whole marketing of this movie.
Is this Snow White ?
디즈니 역사상 최악의 실사 영화...  인어공주에 이은 2연타...<br>이제는 더이상 기대도 안되네요...
"Watch it, but on torrents not in cinema."
Even Wonder Woman couldn&#39;t save this .....
😐hello 😐is 😐anybody😐here 😐
"Disney is trash, and so is this actress! Get them both out of here. Can&#39;t wait for this to flop!"
Why is the actor from snow WHITE not white
"58,000 people who pressed like. Who are they?"
😂😂😂😂😂😂
"I think this is going to be a great movie.if you want a carbon copy of the original, then go out and buy the original"
"Rachel Zegler: I don&#39;t need your business.<br><br>Me: Well, I am not giving you any, to begin with..."
But i love wonder woman so much 😢😢
is the queen wearing a onesie?
当我拉着我的父母说要看这部电影他们说爷爷奶奶去世了所以他们也不敢看😅
Woke White no thank you
"For people who don&#39;t use the extension, currently <br>Likes : 58,760<br>Dislikes: 16,55,205"
"Jokes aside, this movie lookd great"
Anyone else think the evil queen is hot?
